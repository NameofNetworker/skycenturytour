          <h1 class="text-primary">Albania Log</h1>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I have been Albania and want to share something about travel in Albania</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Albania is one European country, and all people look like European nation. Albania is located in the Mediterranean Sea and is close to Greece and Italy. In recent few years, many people start to talk about Albania, and they find there are many English speakers. You will be fine with travelling there if you only know English. You can still watch the famous English channel in Albania.  </p>

          <h4> Tirana Airport</h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Tirana airport could be your first destination if you want to take a flight to travel in Albania. Tirana Airport has one official website, and you can check your flight easily. I would like to access their official website to check the information. For instance, you can conveniently rent a car at the Tirana airport or take a bus to the Capital, Tirana. It is surprising to start the journey in a car, especially you have just arrived in a country. You may need to rent a car as you start to travel. You can go to many places as soon as possible with a rental car. The one thing that you must think about is parking a car.</p>

          <h4> Tirana </h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I took the bus to Capital Tirana(Skanderbeg Square) from the airport, which is very cheap. You can still take a bus to return to Tirana Airport in the same place. You can exchange Albanian Lek at the airport or the Capital Tirana currency exchange. Euro is widely accepted, and you can prepare some euros before you travel there.</p>
        <p>There are many tourist attractions in the Capital, Tirana. I suggest you go to Daijt mountains and Petrele by taxi or rental car. Daijt Mountains is close to the city centre of Tirana, and you can check their website before you go there. In general, every Tuesday they will close their service.</p>

          <h4>Durres </h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There is a seaside view in Durres. You can go to South and North Albania Bus Station in the Capital, Tirana, and take a bus to go there. </p>

        <p>If you have a rental car, you could go to many places easily.</p>

        <p> There are some important items you need to have or remember.</p>
