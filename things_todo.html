          <h1 class="text-primary">Things To Do in Albania</h1>

        </blockquote>
        

        <p>Many people may not know where they are going and what they can do there. We could summarize some things before we make our travel plan.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <h4> Food </h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You could find some famous or most-viewed restaurants there. As we said, Albania is located in the Mediterranean Sea, and you can buy many kinds of seafood there. If you book a flat, you could cook some seafood for yourself to control your budget. There are lots of seafood markets or shopping markets where you can hang around and buy your food materials. Even though you could find many socialism elements like China or some Asian countries, they are English speakers and like coffee or European food.   </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <h4> Outdoor Activities</h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are many exciting outdoor activities. Maybe you can ride a horse in the Dajti mountains. You can also find a beach to swim in with your family or friends. At the same time, you can book a boat tour or wildlife tour if you want. Based on common sense, we can always find traditional festivals in one country. </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <h4>Entertainment Center</h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you do not like outdoor activities, maybe you could play Nintendo Switch or Playstation with others in one gaming store. Sports fields or movie cinemas are very popular. Travel does not mean you can not enjoy entertainment projects like you stay in your countries. </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <h4>Study or Work </h4>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We know travel means communication or understanding of culture. We could talk to others in English(one language) in real situations or through Telegram(WhatsApp) during travel. If you want to become bilingual, it is a convenient and affordable way. You only need to spend a little money or time to find a language environment, and you are in a travel environment. Like many language learners, they never find a language environment. That is why we do not have the confidence to say they are bilingual.</p>
        <p>Studying aboard and working aboard are very common to see in this century. You could become a student or capitalist in one country. Albania could be one choice for studying or working. Studying in Albania is not very popular now. Their styles of school buildings are like those in China or some Asian countriesðŸ˜„. Some people may find a chance to develop tourism in one country, and they could build a travel agency to help others.</p>
        <p>Real capitalists will think about geolocation, weather and language environment in Big Earth. They need to save time, distance and money when they run a business. In the past, humans built many trade and transport companies in all countries. In this century, we have many product lines or supply chains in one country. We rely on technology and land resources to produce many products, not import or export from overseas capitals. We may not need many trade companies to buy products from other countries, while we need many bilinguals or agencies to buy consulting services. Tourism is based on land, geolocation, and humans, which helps many people find jobs. It is not hard to build a company in Albania, and they are English speaker. Sometimes, people just worry about the environment. There is still time to change our business strategies when the environment changes.</p>
        <p>When we talk about travel, it is not only travel. There are many topics we could discuss. I want to talk about Albania because of its geolocation, business environment, language environment, friendly visa and some socialism elements. As for other countries in the Mediterranean Sea, I think we need to research their situations first and prepare some papers to apply for a valid visa. Time is very short, so we can start our first trip to Albania now.</p>
